# Compiling data reports
One of the final steps in a data analytics project is the eventual reporting on data and what you have uncovered through your data analysis. This chapter focuses on how to compile a useful report that communicates the results as accurately as possible. This is important because the chances are that the person reading your report is not a statistician.

## Determine your audience
The first step to reporting is to determine the audience that you are reporting to. This is a major driver in how you structure your content, what parts you might omit, and what parts you might highlight. Consider two scenarios; in the first, you are writing a report for a colleague statistician, in another case you are writing for a manager of a firm.

In the case of the statistician, you can assume that the person knows about statistical analysis and knows all the things to take into account when drawing conclusions. The statistician knows what the significance is of your sample size. The statistician also is your colleague and you know that they will not do anything rash with the data. In such a case you might want to focus much more on the methods you used to validate that your research was adequate with your colleague.

Taking a look at the manager, the dynamic is completely different. A manager is in charge of some piece of business and depending on the report you bring, they might choose to move the business in a certain direction. Focussing on your research method would add noise to this decision making process. The focus here would much more be to highlight the results and maybe more importantly, to communicate clearly on what basis those results are useful or dangerous to use. If your sample size was relatively small, the results might not be an accurate representation of the truth. If you do not accentuate this fact accordingly, you might end up giving a poor impression of your research.

## Figures are just pictures if there is no text
Regardless of who your audience is, always keep in mind that whatever figure you place in the report, it should come with its own description and interpretation of what that figure means. If you do not explain a figure or graph, it is open to interpretation and can result in more confusion than clarity.

## Correlation is not causation
Though it feels great to be able to show that you found some relation between data, that does not necessarily mean that this relation is in fact causal. Correlation versus causation remains one of the biggest errors that can be made in statistical analysis. Always be very cautious about reporting on a correlation and make sure that you support adequately what that relation is; regardless of whether it is causation or just correlation.
