Within data we can make various subdivisions in the type of data we work with. The first distinction we make is between **quantitative data** (to be further divided **interval data** and ratio data ) and **qualitative data** (to be subdivided into **nominal data**, **ordered data** and **unstructured data**).

# Qualitative data versus quantitative data

The big difference in the first distinctions is that qualitative data has no numerical restrictions on the type of answer. Think of open questions, such as What is your opinion on income leveling? Or How do you determine which Netflix series is worth watching? But also questions with an arbitrary predetermined answer like What is the most beautiful color in a rainbow? The type of answers can vary enormously and are very open to interpretation, especially when it comes to an open answer. Such an answer is difficult to analyze using statistical methods. What these kinds of questions particularly excel at is _exploratory_ research. Due to the free form of the answers, you are not limited in your own assumptions and you get a wide variety of insights about a subject. These are good tools for forming hypotheses.

Quantitative data is the structured counterpart to qualitative data. The answer often is subject to certain limitations. Think of a question like _On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did you like 'The Wire'?_ Or _How many days did you work in the past week?_ Thanks to these limitations, you have a much better expectation of what answers you get and that results in more forms of analysis that you can apply. We therefore mainly use quantitative data to test hypotheses.

The relationship between the two in many cases is that with the aid of qualitative research we determine what kind of quantitative research we will do. A qualitative research question could be _What are factors in the decision to buy a house?_ You could discover through the open answers that **price**, **location** and **current housing costs** are frequently mentioned factors. The follow-up quantitative study might then answer a question like _How big is the effect of house prices on the decision of buying a house?_

# Nominal data

Nominal data is also called categorical data and you can compare it with labels. It is just a name that indicates a certain value. An example question is:

_What color is this dress?_

With answer options:

* **red**
* **green**
* **blue**

_What you can calculate with responses is what the ratio is between the given answers, so What percentage of the respondents filled in **blue** ?_

# Ordered data

Ordered data is similar to nominal data in many ways, with the exception that there is an order in the defined answer options. Think of a question like:

_What do you think about peanut butter with chunks?_

With options:

1. **disgusting**
1. **ok**
1. **tasty**

Here is a very clear order in the values: disgusting is the least tasty, followed by ok, which is followed by tasty.

# Interval data

Interval data builds on top of ordered data with the added feature that steps are exactly measurable between the ordered possibilities. An example question is:

_How many degrees is it where you are now?_

Suppose we get two answers: **20 degrees** and **25 degrees**, then we can describe the exact difference between these 2 values: **5 degrees**.

# Ratio data

Ratio data is interval data with the additional condition that the data must have an 'absolute zero' and so the difference between 2 points can be expressed as a ratio. An example question could be What is your age? If you want to test whether you are dealing with interval or ratio data, you can look at 2 numeric values that have a 2: 1 ratio. If they also have a 2: 1 ratio semantically, then you are dealing with ratio data, otherwise it is interval data. A more concrete example: 20 degrees is not twice as warm as 10 degrees - we have after all, no 'absolute zero' with degrees. What we can say is that 20 years is twice as long as 10 years.
