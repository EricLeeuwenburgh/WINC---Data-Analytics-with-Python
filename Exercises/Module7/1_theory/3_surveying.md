# Surveying
In a survey you construct a list of questions that match the data that you need to answer your research question. You then distribute the survey amongst a population and end up with a dataset. A tool used commonly for this is google forms. In this chapter we look at how a survey can impact the data that you end up collecting. It is important to understand the mistakes that can be made in surveying in order to have a better grasp of the reliability of the answers and the resulting conclusions thereof.

## Formulating a question

Each question in a survey must be formulated carefully. The first goal is to make sure that the answer to the question yields the type of data that you actually need. For instance, you might ask "how long have you been working at your current company?" - one responder might answer in years, whereas antoher might answer in months. In this case we would want to be really specific about what scale of time we are using.

Another thing to take into account is that the wording can be interpreted very differently. What exactly is meant by "working at your current company?" Is it being part of the company? Is it working in a specific role? Is it working in a specific layer of the company? The more ambiguity you can remove from your question, the better the answers will be.

It is also possible to take this too far; if you were to explain every element of a question, you risk making the question so complex that it will still not yield accurate answers.

You must also take into account what the knowledge level of your population is in regards to a certain topic. You might be interested in the annual revenue of a company, but unless your population consists of people from the financial branch of a firm, you might have participants that do not know the answer to this question.

A thing to also take into account is how wording can steer the population into giving a specific answer. Impeding a positive tone in a question can result in a more positive response. When formulating a question, try to remove as much bias from it as possible to ensure truthful responses.

When talking of truthfulness, you must also take into account social desirability. You might ask a question that is socially questionable; in such a case it is possible that a respondent might give you the socially accepted answer over what he or she actually thinks. A way to mitigate this is to stress the anonymity of a survey. Usually this also means not including any (or very minimal) demographic questions in your survey.

If you end up constructing a survey, it is good practice to have a rigorous systematic review done by other people. This way you can figure out if the questions in your survey are understood consistently and if people will respond in the way that you expect them to respond.

## Dealing with errors

Regardless of how well your questions are formulated, you will run into erroneuos data. This could be in part because in spite of your careful question design a respondent still misunderstood the question, but it could also be a result of a typo where a user write **78** instead of **87**. This kind of error can get worse if subsequent questions hinge on this first answer and this can in turn invalidate an entire response.

Unfortunately there is no magic way of catching these errors; the only reliable method is human scrutiny. This is also why data cleaning is such a large part of data science - a data scientist must asses each and every response before committing it to a usable dataset.
