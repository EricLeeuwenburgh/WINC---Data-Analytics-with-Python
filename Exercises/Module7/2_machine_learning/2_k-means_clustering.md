# K-means clustering
K-means clustering is a Machine Learning algorithm that can be used to partition data into groups, or clusters. Some examples of data that you might want to cluster are:

- groups of customers (high, medium and low spenders)
- wines (high, medium and low quality)
- environmental policies of countries and their effects
- sounds of vehicles (trucks, regular cars, motor cycles)

## How K-means clustering works

The math behind K-means clustering can seem a little complex but the StatQuest YouTube channel visualizes this really nicely.

Note: You don't need to completely understand the math behind K-means clustering to be able to use it.
