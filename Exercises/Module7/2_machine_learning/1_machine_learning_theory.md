## Terms
You should now be able to give a simple explanation on the following terms:

- Machine Learning
- a ML model
- supervised learning
- unsupervised learning

## Machine Learning as a Service
As you've seen the field of Machine Learning (ML) is quite broad. There are a lot of different applications of ML as well.

One thing that's good to know is that using a product that internally uses ML is less work than doing all of the ML work yourself. There are definitely situations where an organisation would want to do the ML work itself, but buying ML services can be a sound financial decision. This is not an or/or decision, there are also companies that offer services (for example infrastructure) to do ML work on top of.

When an organisation offers Machine Learning services this is also sometimes called "Machine Learning as a Service" or MLAAS. Please read this(opens in a new tab) article to see the various kinds MLAAS are available. Don't worry if you don't know some of the terminology used.
