<!--  
Please formulate an answer to the following three questions in your report:
     1. What is the biggest predictor of a large CO2 output per capita of a country?
     2. which countries are making the biggest strides in decreasing CO2 output?
     3. which non-fossil fuel energy technology will have the best price in the future?

# Report - CO2 Emissions
This analysis is part of the WINC Academy course: 'Data Analytics with Python - Module 7'.

## Gathering data
For this assignment I am allowed to use any dataset for the following website: https://ourworldindata.org/

__List of datasources__
co2-by-sector: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co-emissions-by-sector
_Emissions are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO₂e), based on 100-year global warming potential factors for non-CO₂ gases. Emissions are broken down by sector. _

co2-change-annual-pct: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/change-co2-annual-pct
_Carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from fossil fuels and industry. Land use change is not included._

co2-per-capita: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co-emissions-per-capita
_Carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from fossil fuels and industry. Land use change is not included_

co2-per-capita-consumption-vs-production: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/consumption-vs-production-co2-per-capita
_Consumption-based emissions are national emissions that have been adjusted for trade. This measures fossil fuel and industry emissions. Land use change is not included._

co2-per-capita-vs-population-growth: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co-emissions-per-capita-vs-population-growth
_Shown are annual consumption-based carbon dioxide emissions. Consumption-based emissions are national emissions that have been adjusted for trade. It's production-based emissions minus emissions embedded in exports, plus emissions embedded in imports._

co2-per-capita-vs-gdp: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-emissions-vs-gdp
_This measures CO₂ emissions from fossil fuels and industry only – land use change is not included._

energy-per-capita-source-stacked: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-energy-source-stacked
_Primary energy is calculated based on the 'substitution method' which takes account of the inefficiencies in fossil fuel production by converting non-fossil energy into the energy inputs required if they had the same conversion losses as fossil fuels._

population-density: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-density
_The number of people per km² of land area._

registered-vehicles-per-1000-people: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/registered-vehicles-per-1000-people
_The total number of registered vehicles (i.e. vehicles reported to a government agency and given some form of registration) per 1,000 people in each country._


## Analysis: What is the biggest predictor of a large CO2 output per capita of a country?
