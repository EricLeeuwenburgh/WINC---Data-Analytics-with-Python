# Reporting on data analyses
Your reports should be written in regular document formats. If you're (also) writing for a technical audience you can choose to attach your notebook and a link to your data sources if relevant.

Read this article on how to write about your data analyses. Also read the PDF that the article links to:

**What should a data-analysis write-up look like?**
Writing up the results of a data analysis is not a skill that anyone is born with. It requires practice and, at least in the beginning, a bit of guidance.

_Organization_
When writing your report, organization will set you free. A good outline is: 1) overview of the problem, 2) your data and modeling approach, 3) the results of your data analysis (plots, numbers, etc), and 4) your substantive conclusions.

1) Overview
Describe the problem. What substantive question are you trying to address? This needn’t be long, but it should be clear.

2) Data and model
What data did you use to address the question, and how did you do it? When describing your approach, be specific. For example:

Don’t say, “I ran a regression” when you instead can say, “I fit a linear regression model to predict price that included a house’s size and neighborhood as predictors.”
Justify important features of your modeling approach. For example: “Neighborhood was included as a categorical predictor in the model because Figure 2 indicated clear differences in price across the neighborhoods.”
Sometimes your Data and Model section will contain plots or tables, and sometimes it won’t. If you feel that a plot helps the reader understand the problem or data set itself—as opposed to your results—then go ahead and include it. A great example here is Tables 1 and 2 in the main paper on the PREDIMED study. These tables help the reader understand some important properties of the data and approach, but not the results of the study itself.

3) Results
In your results section, include any figures and tables necessary to make your case. Label them (Figure 1, 2, etc), give them informative captions, and refer to them in the text by their numbered labels where you discuss them. Typical things to include here may include: pictures of the data; pictures and tables that show the fitted model; tables of model coefficients and summaries.

4) Conclusion
What did you learn from the analysis? What is the answer, if any, to the question you set out to address?

**General advice**
Make the sections as short or long as they need to be. For example, a conclusions section is often pretty short, while a results section is usually a bit longer.

It’s OK to use the first person to avoid awkward or bizarre sentence constructions, but try to do so sparingly.

Do not include computer code unless explicitly called for. Note: model outputs do not count as computer code. Outputs should be used as evidence in your results section (ideally formatted in a nice way). By code, I mean the sequence of commands you used to process the data and produce the outputs.

When in doubt, use shorter words and sentences.

A very common way for reports to go wrong is when the writer simply narrates the thought process he or she followed: :First I did this, but it didn’t work. Then I did something else, and I found A, B, and C. I wasn’t really sure what to make of B, but C was interesting, so I followed up with D and E. Then having done this…” Do not do this. The desire for specificity is admirable, but the overall effect is one of amateurism. Follow the recommended outline

 # Outline example for report
1. Overview of the Problem:
Start by providing a brief introduction to the problem you are addressing. Clearly state the objective or research question you aimed to answer through your data analysis. Summarize the context, significance, and any relevant background information related to the problem.

2. Your Data and Modeling Approach:
In this section, describe the data you used for analysis. Mention the source, sample size, and any relevant characteristics or limitations of the data. If you performed any data preprocessing or cleaning, briefly outline the steps taken.

Next, explain your modeling approach. If you used any specific statistical techniques or algorithms, provide a high-level description. Include any assumptions made during the analysis process. Make sure to justify your choices by explaining why you believe your approach is appropriate for addressing the problem at hand.

3. Results of Your Data Analysis:
Present your findings and results in a concise and organized manner. Use clear and informative visualizations such as plots, charts, or tables to display key insights from your analysis. Ensure that the visuals are properly labeled and easy to understand.
Accompany the visuals with a brief explanation of each result, highlighting the main observations or trends. If applicable, provide any statistical measures or significance levels that support your findings. It's important to strike a balance between providing enough information and keeping the report concise.

4. Your Substantive Conclusions:
Conclude the report by summarizing the main conclusions drawn from your analysis. Restate the research question or objective and explain how your results address it. Discuss the implications of your findings and their relevance to the problem at hand.
If appropriate, suggest potential further steps or recommendations based on your conclusions. Acknowledge any limitations or potential sources of error in your analysis, as this demonstrates a critical and thoughtful approach.

Remember to keep the report focused, prioritizing the most relevant information. Be clear, concise, and avoid unnecessary technical jargon. Proofread your report for grammar and clarity, ensuring that it flows smoothly and effectively communicates your analysis.

# Differences reports for technical and non technical audience
## For a Technical Audience:

1. Use Technical Terminology: You can use specialized terminology, abbreviations, and acronyms that are familiar to the technical audience. However, avoid excessive jargon and provide explanations or definitions for complex terms when necessary.

2. Include Technical Details: Provide in-depth explanations of the data analysis methods, algorithms, and statistical techniques used. Include code snippets, mathematical formulas, or specific technical steps followed during the analysis. Your audience will likely have a solid understanding of the subject matter, so you can delve into more technical aspects without overwhelming them.

3. Emphasize Technical Findings: Focus on the technical insights, statistical measures, and detailed results that the technical audience will find valuable. Provide comprehensive and detailed visualizations, numerical data, and analysis outputs. Technical experts typically want to see the finer details of the analysis process.

## For a Non-Technical Audience:

1. Use Plain Language: Avoid or minimize technical jargon, abbreviations, and complex terminology. Use everyday language that is easily understood by individuals who may not have a technical background. If you need to use technical terms, provide simple explanations or analogies to enhance understanding.

2. Simplify Complex Concepts: Break down complex data analysis techniques into simpler explanations. Focus on the high-level concepts and provide clear examples or visualizations that illustrate key findings. Use storytelling techniques and real-life scenarios to make the report relatable and engaging.

3. Provide Context and Interpretation: Offer clear explanations of the problem, the data, and the analysis approach in a way that is accessible to non-technical readers. Instead of overwhelming them with technical details, focus on the practical implications and actionable insights. Use plain language to describe the significance of the findings and how they relate to the problem or question at hand.

4. Use Visuals Effectively: Utilize visuals such as charts, graphs, or infographics to convey information visually. Make sure the visuals are easy to understand, well-labeled, and accompanied by simple explanations or captions. Visuals can help non-technical readers grasp the main points of your analysis quickly.

5. Summarize Key Findings: Provide a clear and concise summary of the main findings and conclusions. Focus on the big picture and the practical implications of the analysis. Avoid overwhelming the readers with too much detail or technicalities.
