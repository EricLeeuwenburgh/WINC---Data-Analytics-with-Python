# LinkedIn is going to be your online business card

**To land a job faster, you can also let the recruiter come to you. To do this, LinkedIn is the medium to gain exposure.** In this digital world, it can come as no surprise that we all need a digital resume as well. Especially if you want to bring your career to new heights, online visibility & findability are key. In this chapter we will help you make sure that your LinkedIn profile will stand out for your future employer.

# Keywords

LinkedIn is a great opportunity to be visible to recruiters in your field. However, you need to know how to get the **algorithm** on your side.

For recruiters to find you, we need to work with the algorithm of LinkedIn. Keywords are one way to make yourself visible online. Therefore we want you to think about the most important keywords to describe your career ambitions. These can vary from appealing job titles, to an industry description, or your technical skills. By being aware of these keywords before building your new and shiny LinkedIn profile, you will be able to create a very effective profile.

- **Write down a list of words that describe your career ambitions.** What are the professional characteristics you want to be found for? Think of your preferred industry, job title, goals, company values - you name it.

- **Specify this list with words that describe the specific type of job you are after.** Make sure you cover your technical skills, soft skills, the industry, job title, geographical preference and employment type such as full time/part time/internship.

- **Write out the most important synonyms for the keywords on your lists.** If applicable for your ambitions or field, work in multiple languages.

- **Save this list** so you can keep it close when building your LinkedIn profile.


# Building your profile

When building your online profile, remember your goal: 
**attracting recruiters** from the field you are interested in.

When building your LinkedIn profile, there are a few key sections you must consider. Each section has its own purpose and provides you with an opportunity to stand out for the recruiter. However, you don't need to reinvent the wheel. What you have created for your resume is a great base for building your online profile! **Your photo, headline, biography, contact details, and of course your professional experience can be copied and pasted to your profile.** The same applies for your courses, projects and voluntary work.

- **Upload a professional looking photo.** That can be just the same as the one on your resume!

- **Create a headline that includes some of your keywords.** Make use of your previous work: using your resume headline is a great start. However, you have some extra space on LinkedIn so you can add some details. Make sure the headline supports your career ambitions and is understandable for recruiters. Have a look at our examples below.

- **Set the 'open to work' settings to your current wishes.** You can find it just below your headline and the more you fill out, the easier it will be for a recruiter to find you. 

- **Write an 'about' section and make sure to end it with a call to action.** Make use of the resume biography you've already written. Again, you are not limited in space, so feel free to add more details on LinkedIn. Complete it with more information on your job requirements (job title, full time/part time). End with your contact details, make it easy for the recruiter to reach out to you. Check out our examples below.

- **Add your work experience.** Again, make use of what you already have. This time, make sure to talk more about your responsibilities and tasks. Maybe you booked results you are exceptionally proud of? Or you joined (or started) an extra project group? Mention it. No need to limit yourself in the amount of information you share on LinkedIn.

- **Add your educational history.** Make use of what you already have and add any educational experiences you left out on your resume. Also use this space to share some key insights, topics you studied, good results or side projects you were involved in.

- **Add your certificates.** No matter how big or small, share it!

- **Add your skills.** No need to limit yourself here. This time technical skills and soft skills can be combined. This section can really boost your visibility on LinkedIn, so use it.

- **Remember to drop your keywords throughout your profile.**

Example 'About':
#1 After a long career in retail management, I made the decision to retrain as a Back-End Developer. I have always loved systems and as store manager I spent a lot of time managing online stock databases, doing very simple coding to organize them. In my free time I like to repair and improve cars - another system I enjoy diving into! I knew I wanted to learn more about programming to turn this into my full-time job. So, I joined Winc Academy and graduated from their Back-End course in 2021.

I am now looking for a junior Back-End Developer position within 30 minutes drive of Enschede, ideally full-time but I would be open to 4 days a week if necessary. My preference would be a job where I can build and maintain APIs and webhooks, as this is what I enjoy most. I have learned to code in Python, Java, and JavaScript, but I don’t yet know Ruby or PHP. I would be open to learning this on the job! In general, I am looking for a junior role so that I can further develop my skills: I do not think my learning is ever really finished in programming, and I am open to a position where I will receive further training.

You can see my portfolio below for examples of my work (Github link). If you think I could help your company with your data architecture, send me an email at brian@brianb.nl and we can set up a meeting.

#2 I’m an experienced and data-driven recruitment consultant with a proven track record of filling complex vacancies. I win the trust of clients and candidates by striving for excellence through data-driven decision-making. I believe continuous learning results in a happier life and more career fulfillment, which is why I follow at least one course a year. Most recently I graduated from Data Analytics with Power Bi, at Winc Academy. Among other things, this course taught me how to identify top candidates and analyze what the best hires have in common. Growing up in a family with four other siblings, I've learned to be an authentic relationship builder who truly connects and listens to others.

At the moment I am looking for a new job (full-time or 36 hours minimum) in or near Amsterdam. I have 5 years of experience in recruitment and for my latest role I sourced for our largest account and led training for our new hires. So let me know if you’re looking for a great and data-driven recruiter, or if you know anyone who is hiring! I would also love to help you, or your network, to the next step on the career ladder. Just connect with me! I'm convinced that in the end, we all strive for the same things: personal growth, inspiring relationships, freedom and success.

The best way to reach me is via example@gmail.com or send me a DM. Looking forward to meeting you!
