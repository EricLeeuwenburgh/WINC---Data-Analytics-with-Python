# Step 1: Conduct desk research


**Spend time researching your vacancy.**
Make use of the vacancy text, LinkedIn, your search engine and the company website.

It's good to do thorough research to tailor your application to the vacancy. However, if you have a tendency to lose yourself in these kinds of activities and spend hours on it, limit yourself to one hour. That should be more than enough.


**Write down your key findings.** Among others they should clarify:

Their description of the ideal candidate;
possible projects the team is working on;
the company's culture, vision & mission;
key takeaways from news articles;
findings on the size and structure of the company
main industry trends.

**Write down any questions that you have.** Some you might find answers to during your desk research. Others might stay unanswered for you, but note them down as well!

Now that you have a list of questions ready, it's time to get them answered. As we told you in the video, the way to get these answers is by picking up the phone and asking them. Sounds simple right? However, for a lot of people it also sounds a bit frightening. Good news: we are here to help you prepare! 

Are you ready for the second step?


# Step 2: Make a phone call to the hiring manager

**Make a selection of questions** that you really want to have answered before you apply. Save the other questions for later, as they might come in handy for the potential job interview.

**Have a look at our examples below** if you are uncertain about your questions. They are just to get you started. Be critical: some of these questions might not be relevant to your vacancy or might already have been answered during your desk research.

**Time to pick up the phone and get these questions answered.** The moment of truth: call the hiring manager, recruiter, team manager or whoever is in charge of the vacancy and ask your questions. Youâ€™ve got this!

Do you find it difficult to pick up the phone? Practice beforehand with someone you know. Or first call a vacancy owner of a role that you find less interesting. Or think of possible scenarios/reactions of the person you are calling, so you won't be overwhelmed in the moment if these happen.
