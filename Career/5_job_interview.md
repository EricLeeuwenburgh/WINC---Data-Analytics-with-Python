# Job Interview

## Preparation

#### "Good preparation is half the work" definitely applies to a job interview, as you can predict important interview questions.

You made it to the last step in your application process: Preparing for the Job Interview. Congratulations! In this chapter we are going to make sure you will leave an irresistible impression at the job interview. At this stage of the application, good preparation is the key to success. Good preparation boosts your confidence, supports solid answers, and shows respect to the other people at the table. We are going to help you with this!

## The STAR-method

During a job interview, the interviewer will try to figure out **what kind of behavior** they can expect from a possible new hire.

**Interviewers often ask behavior-based questions** to figure out how you handled specific situations like a challenging interpersonal situation, deadlines, and big projects. For examples questions like ‘’Can you give me an example of a time you faced a conflict with a coworker? How did you handle that?’’ or ‘’You mentioned you are creative - can you share a situation where you demonstrated this capability?’’

The STAR method helps you formulate **a good answer** and forces you to **share past experience in a positive and structured way**. Past behavior is seen as a good predictor of the future and helps the hiring manager to create an image of how you function. But how do you use the STAR method? You formulate your answer in four steps, let's go over them.

1. **S**ituation sketch
2. **T**asks
3. **A**ctions
4. **R**esults

#### Step 1 - Make a Situation Sketch

You start with outlining a situation in which you demonstrated the behavior the hiring manager is asking you about. The hiring manager wants to hear how you acted in **a situation that differs from your usual work environment and tasks**. Think about a challenge you faced: this could be an interaction with a challenging client, a big project, or another unusually difficult situation. Make sure the situation holds their attention and address the urgency of the situation you were in. Go for a event that took place **not too long ago**. 

Let's look at an example of a candidate who was asked to demonstrate their _flexibility_:

‘’One time, at my last job, our sales were decreasing because people didn’t come to the store anymore. They were afraid of Covid-19 and the impact on their health. The traffic on our webshop was increasing massively, but the check-out was still unstable. The responsible coworker for the e-commerce department had a family emergency and needed to miss work for some time.”


#### Step 2 - Describe your Tasks in the Situation

Describe **the responsibility** you had, and **the goal** and **the tasks** that belonged with it. Clearly formulate how the tasks and responsibilities in this specific situation **differed from your regular job** responsibilities and day-to-day tasks. 

Let's continue with the same examples:

‘’My job is in Relationship Management, but in my spare time I spend a lot of time building websites and increasing traffic through SEO and SEA. I made my supervisor aware of this after he filled me in on the online challenges the company was facing. He instructed me to take on the issues with the webshop.”


#### Step 3 - Explain the Actions you Took to Relieve or Rectify the Situation

This step is where you can go **more in-depth** with your explanation as it is what ultimately shows the hiring manager how **you behave in critical situations**. Take your time to identify and discuss the most impactful steps you took to **overcome the challenge** of the situation. This is not a moment to be too modest. 

Our examples continues as follows:

‘’First I discussed the workload and my most important responsibilities with my current team. Luckily I was able to delegate some of my core responsibilities within the Relation Team. This allowed me to give full focus to the critical situation. After this, I requested (and was granted) a crash course on Web Development, providing me with the expertise to work on the issues professionally. At the same time I set up a new check-out process, and scheduled daily meetings with both the Finance and IT department to keep them informed and included of what was happening. 


#### Step 4 - Share the Results of your Work

Decide on the two or three **most impactful outcomes** of your action. Quantify the outcome wherever possible to keep it as concrete as possible. In addition, discuss what the situation **taught you**. 

In our example, that looks like:

‘’With some tasks delegated, I was able to dedicate more time to the special project. This allowed me to fix the webshops problems in only two weeks, including the time I spent on the crash course. Our online sales increased by almost 40% and the return rate of our customers has become much higher. My supervisor appreciated my flexibility and drive, and I was given several more related projects after that, along with an eventual promotion."


_That's the STAR method explained! It will take  some practice to naturally formulate your answers in this way. However, the great thing about an interview is that you can prepare most of your answers beforehand! There are a lot of commonly asked questions, which we will share with you in the next section. We challenge you to formulate some of your answers using the STAR method. _


## Top 10 Interview Questions

Have a look at the **top 10 most commonly asked questions** at a job interview and prepare your answers.

In order to formulate a strong answer, think about **why** the hiring manager is asking you the question. **What does the interviewer hope to learn about you through asking this question?** We’ll highlight the likely purpose of these 10 most common questions. You can first have a read through the questions and our tips below. But you might want to keep in mind already that your next To Do will be to prepare your own answers to all of these questions.


**1. Can you tell me something about yourself?**

**What is the purpose?**
To allow the interviewer to hear a short summary of your professional background, your motivation for applying and who you are as a person. 

**How to answer?**
Don’t be afraid to take your time to answer this question. Around 2 to 3 minutes should work. This pitch of yours will be their first impression of you, so make sure to prepare this question out loud. 

A logical approach to answer this question is by starting with a **short introduction on your personal life**, where you can elaborate on your family situation, area of residence and your hobbies. When you share a piece of information, make sure to speak to the imagination of the listener. Don’t just mention you have a dog, but mention one of his many tricks or where you like to walk him. For those of you who have found common ground with the hiring manager in their desk research, this is your chance to mention it. Let the hiring manager know that you started your education at the same university and you found this on Linkedin. This shows interest and respect.

Continue your introduction with a **summary of your professional career**. Only mention the highlights and try to focus on the most relevant parts for this application. Finish with an elaboration on what brings you here, at the job interview. What part of the vacancy grabbed your attention and why are you motivated by it? Let them know you are excited for this role!


**2. Why are you leaving your current employer?** 

**What is the purpose?**
For the hiring manager to find out how you handle undesirable situations and reasons why you might leave a company. 

**How to answer?**
Formulate a clear but brief explanation of why you want to leave/left, but mainly use this question as an opportunity to **elaborate on what you like about their vacancy**. Remain positive. No hiring manager will fault you for wanting to have well-rounded experience and gain a new perspective in your career. 

The (very) short version of a good answer might be: ‘’I left to work on a product I was very passionate about.” or ‘’I had been with the organization for a number of years and wanted to experience a new environment to continue growing.’’


**3. Why do you want to work here?**

**What is the purpose?**
Possibly that the hiring manager wants to know about your career goals and how this role fits into your plan. They might also want to test you about your knowledge of the company, industry and position. This is where the well-prepared candidates score all the points.  

**How to answer?**
A good approach to answer this question is by **making reference to the motivation in your cover letter** and sharing which aspects of the company and job are appealing to you. These reasons could include the company's general reputation, the products or services they offer, admiration of other company initiatives (marketing campaigns/training programs), the company culture and values or anything else you can think of. 

A practical tip: **prepare at least three points** which make you want to work for this company and be able to explain why this is.


**4. What are you good at? / What are your strengths?**

**What is the purpose?**
To find out if you are the best person for the job and if your strengths align with the vacancy needs. Your answer to this question might very well be the reason why you are hired. Prepare your answer on questions like these by using the STAR method.

**How to answer?**
Be well prepared to talk about your strengths. Even when this question is not asked, you must be able to answer it in order to land the job. **Practice talking about at least three capabilities** you truly believe you are good at, and are also most valuable to the role and company. Each strength should be supported with an example from the past to demonstrate your capability. Never just summarize the three capabilities but make them believable with the **STAR method**. How to do this is discussed  further in question number five.


**5. Give an example of a time when you showed _competency_?**

**What is the purpose?**
The purpose of this question depends on the competency that is being asked about. Whether this is ‘’initiative’’, ‘’leadership, or ‘’creativity’’, the result of your answer will be different. Yet, every answer should **convince the reader of your ability** in this competency and should clarify your understanding of the meaning of the competency. They ask the question because they need assurance that you can do something or be something. Especially when it comes in addition to question number four.

**How to answer?**
As this is a behavioral question, the approach to answer the question is with the help of the STAR-method, illustrating each of your strengths with examples from the past. Make sure to prepare an answer for the most relevant skills of your application. Spend extra time on preparing strong examples of your three most valuable skills, as mentioned in question four.


**6. What is a development point / wat areas need improvement?**

**What is the purpose?**
To determine the skill level of potential employees and predict their willingness to improve and advance their careers. Many candidates might not like this question, but if you stay calm and formulate your answer with our tips, this question is an opportunity to **show your positivity and willingness to learn**.

**How to answer?**
Prepare an answer in which you address an area for improvement, but one which is not important for the role. For example, as a Data Analyst you can’t say that you’re chaotic, because they are probably looking for someone who can structure data in a calm, orderly way. An area for improvement which isn’t at odds with the vacancy, might be ‘’networking’’. For most Data Analysts this isn’t a critical skill. It's just nice to have.

When you have decided on your development area, the second part of your answer must describe how you’re improving in that area. Making an effort to improve can show employers that you're willing to invest in your professional development. This can make you a valuable candidate and increase your likelihood of getting a job offer.


**7. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?**

**What is the purpose?**
A tricky one - the purpose of this question might be that the interviewer wants to test your ambitions and see if this matches the potential of your vacancy. 

**How to answer?**
You can never know for sure what the career opportunities in a new organization are, and you do not want the interviewer to worry whether they can offer a certain path to you. Or even worse, you don't want to give the team manager the feeling that you are after his/her job. Therefore, this is the only part in your whole application that we advise you to **keep vague**. 

Formulate an answer in which you **share your excitement** to get started in the role you are applying for right now. That you still have so much to do and learn here, that you first want to focus on this bit, before looking further in the future.


**8. Why should I hire you?**

**What is the purpose?**
This is a **critical question** in the hiring process as the reason behind it is often that the hiring manager is still looking for a little persuasion. If the question is asked, it is often at the end of the interview and it’s up to you to show how you are different from the talent pool. It is also a deliberately confrontational question checking that you can hold up under pressure.  

**How to answer?**
Put a lot of thought into your answer and don’t say something like ‘’this is up to you to decide’’. When you get this question, try to **see it as an opportunity**. You can now explain why they should bring you in. Prepare a sales pitch for yourself which is unique and convincing. Describe what you are good at, **your added** value for the vacancy, **your results** at previous employers, and why you are **highly motivated** to succeed in this role. Take your time to answer the interviewer. If you know from your own experience that you can be modest, try to practice this question out loud until you’re satisfied with your answer. 


**9. You do not have the _experience / competency / degree_, should I be worried?**

**What is the purpose?**
Comparable to the previous one: the interviewer needs a little persuasion here. You already did a great job with the previous steps in the application process, otherwise you wouldn’t have been invited for the interview while missing some of their requirements. Now it is time to give the last push to show your value for the role.

**How to answer?**
This is your change to give a positive swing to the mismatch between your resume and the vacancy. Be prepared to talk about it and **be honest**. Not having all the requirements for the job does not necessarily prevent you from having a successful interview. Yet, the interviewer does need an explanation and reassurance that you will cope while missing a skill they think they need. Take the time beforehand to work out how you can transform missing experience into a positive learning or situation. It might be that you do not have the asked-for degree because you have gained relevant knowledge via another way, it might be that you are willing to follow a course in your own time, or that you might not have the years of experience but you do have the knowledge. You want to be truthful without going into unnecessary detail. 

In addition, when you were invited to the interview the hiring manager was aware of your lack of experience. Yet, something about you attracted their interest. Combine your answer with a **reference to your added value**. Think about what do you have, instead of what you do not have.


**10. Do you have questions for us?**

**What is the purpose?**
The purpose of this question might be something different for every candidate. In some cases the hiring manager is checking your interest in the company and the role, in other situations they may want to reassure themselves that you have all the information you need. 

**How to answer?**
Asking questions can be a good way to reaffirm your interest in the role. With the right questions, you can show your interest in the company and the industry. But remember, most questions should have been asked way before your interview. During your orientation process, for example. What does the application procedure look like? Or an average working day? You should already know by now. 

If you do have all the information you need, then do not ask questions. Your orientation to the role may have covered it all already. If this is the case, don't put on a show for the sake of it - simply inform the hiring manager of your thorough orientation and that you know enough. Do not consume time if you do not mean it: the interviewer will notice this.
