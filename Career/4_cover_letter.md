# Cover letter

#### A good cover letter **sparks the interest** of the hiring manager and **gets you invited** to an interview.

The structure of a good letter consists of, at least, the following four paragraphs:

- Catchy Introduction
- Your Orientation on the Vacancy
- Your Motivation for Applying
- Your Added Value

## Catchy Introduction

Ready to write a catchy introduction yourself? Remember, the main purpose of your introduction is to **grab the attention of the reader**. Below we share some examples:

NOT GOOD: "Further to the role of Junior Front-End Developer as seen on Indeed, I would like to make an application. This is based on my one year of experience in front-end work, which matches your requirements. I believe that I am a good fit with your expectations for this role."

GOOD: "Tomorrow I'm going on holiday, but my empty bags will have to wait a little longer so I can write you this letter. I am doing this because I really want to become your new colleague. I was excited to learn about this job opportunity from our mutual connection, Brian Basson. He thought I would be a good match, given my six years of experience in Salesforce advisory roles and my passion for exploring the world, often made possible through your platform."


## Orientation on the Vacancy

Remember the desk research and phone call you did? This is where it comes in handy again! The purpose of sharing research you have done is to **demonstrate that you have a good understanding of what the role and the company are about**.

- **List all the resources you have used in the orientation phase**. This can be the website, a conversation on LinkedIn with a current employee or the phone call you have made to the hiring manager itself. These notes are the foundation of your second paragraph.
- **Gather the notes that list your findings of the desk research**. Highlight the findings that made you most enthusiastic about the role. Share one or two findings that made you want to apply for the role. To stand out from other candidates, make sure the findings you refer to are ones not found within the vacancy text. This way you show that you have invested your time and effort into researching the role.

Some examples:

GOOD: "After our pleasant conversation last week, I delved further into all available information on the vacancy. Fortunately, there is a lot of information on your website, so I was able to develop a good understanding of what the role and the company is about. I really feel connected with your vision of a family culture company where everyone is welcome - I come from a very close family myself, and want to be in a stable social environment in my work."

GOOD: "Thank you for your time last week in our short phone call. What you told me then really helped me to understand your company’s culture and the projects I would be working on. As I told you then, I could immediately get into Java work, but Ruby would be new for me - since our call, I’ve tested out a couple of lines of code to see how I do, and so far so good! I am really enthusiastic to get started with this aspect of the work."


## Motivation for Applying

Asking the question **"Why?"** three times gets you to the real root of your motivation. 

The core of every cover letter is the motivation of the candidate. In this part of the letter you want to share why you want to work in this role and for this company. The purpose is to take away possible barriers for a hiring manager to invest time and energy in your application. Be true to yourself and the reader.

Motivation to do a job is not the same as your qualifications. Focus on your **drive and ambition**, instead of your skills and experience.

The hiring manager wants to know if you are genuinely enthusiastic about the vacancy and that if they would invest time in your onboarding, you will be there to stay. Therefore, we would like you to write a paragraph on your motivation for this specific role and another paragraph on your motivation to work in this particular company. **Convince them of your enthusiasm!** If you are stuck, we have some examples for you to get your creativity flowing.

- **Answer the following question out loud: Why do you want to work in this role?** Ask yourself at least three more time: But why is that?
- **Use your answers to write a full paragraph about your motivation to fulfill this role.** Use the notes you made during the orientation phase. Refer to the terms used in the vacancy, to speak the language of the recruiter.
- **Answer the following question out loud: Why do you want to work for this company?** And again, ask yourself at least three more time: But why is that?
- **Use your answers to write a full paragraph about your motivation to work at this company.** Use the notes you made during the orientation phase to refer to the company's mission, vision, values and current projects.

Examples - motivation on the Role:

NOT GOOD: "I would love to work with you because I believe to be a good fit for the role of Junior Data Analyst. The past six years I have spent working as a Data Administrator. Here I was responsible for data management and daily analyses. Among other things I worked with Excel and PowerBI. This makes me enthusiastic about the role."

GOOD: "I am motivated by helping everyone in a company to understand their data, which usually means building great dashboards but also being able to explain and present the data verbally. As I love programming and am hungry to learn as much as I can in my first hands-on role I feel that your traineeship is a great fit. It will enable me to enhance knowledge on topics such as design and big data, while gaining experience on the workfloor and using my presentation and social skills."

GOOD: "In my opinion many companies do not ‘join the dots’ in customer service, leading to reduced quality - I want to fix this, to help people and companies. I believe good products deserve a big and loyal group of customers, and good customer service is the way to facilitating this."

Examples - motivation on the Company:

Good: "I would like to join your team because you clearly put the emphasis on development and training for your juniors, as well as hands-on experience from day one. I am especially interested in your nonprofit program, in which you connect tech experts who want to volunteer their skills with nonprofit organizations. This aligns with my own belief that we should use our talents to do good. "

GOOD: "I believe we are a ‘culture’ match because I prefer to work towards quality rather than quantity, and like to take my time in the research and development stages of projects, just like you do."


## Your Added Value

Finally, you will have to convince the reader to invite **YOU**: share your added value and don't be too modest.

The purpose of this paragraph is to **convince the reader of your added value** for the team and this role. Really try to sell your value and make sure to stand out from the other candidates. 

What makes you **stand out** from the other candidates?

Take some time to think about how you stand out from other candidates. This is what the reader will need to know to invite you to the  job interview. Dedicate a full paragraph to your added value, including an example from the past which demonstrates your ability and strengthens your credibility. Also, make the connection between this capability and the added value in the role you are applying for. 

**One last reminder**: your added value should be something that has not been mentioned in the vacancy yet.

- _Think about the questions: What do I have to offer that other candidates might not have? What makes me stand out?_ Write down the skills, personality traits or experiences you think of. Select one or two to highlight in this final paragraph.

- _Think of a previous experience that shows that skill and personality trait._ Write some notes on the specifics of that experience. What was the situation? How did you act? What was the result?

Some examples:

GOOD: "Besides recognizing myself in your description of the ideal candidate,  I believe myself to be a valuable addition to the team. You do not specifically ask for it in the vacancy, but two years ago I set up my own company and built a modest webshop. During this period I learned that there is always a solution to a problem and above all: to be entrepreneurial. I believe that entrepreneurship will be valuable in the role of Front-End Developer, because I can help identify opportunities for your clients and understand their needs & wishes from my own experiences. I would like to combine my commercial drive and entrepreneurship with my technical and creative skills in the role of Front-End Developer.”

GOOD: "To conclude this letter, I’d like to say that my many years working as a teaching assistant may seem a bit ‘far away’ from Data Analytics, and obviously there are big differences. But those years in the classroom taught me how to work in a very organized team, in a busy environment with a lot of different personalities, and how to keep my focus on the tasks, even when there was a lot going on around me, so I could always meet deadlines and get the job done. I think my ability to do this is an asset in any company, and I hope you will see it that way too."
