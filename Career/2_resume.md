# Sharing information

Sharing personal details is a **sensitive topic** in the world of recruitment. What information **adds value** to your application and what information **shouldn't matter** to the reader? In the following two videos we will help you to distinguish between **the do's and don'ts of sharing personal information.** We kick off with the goal of adding a photo to your resume. In the second video we cover personal details and contact information. We will help you decide what you want to share but even more, decide what adds value for the hiring manager.

# Authentic Biography

A biography is the opportunity to share **personality.** Show the
reader that you are more than your diplomas and work history.

You are the only one who can make your resume **personal**, **original** and **genuine**.

It's time to pick up the pen (or keyboard)! The biography is the most creative, and therefore most personal part of your resume. To give your creativity a boost we have shared some examples with you of nice biographies and headlines. But remember: these are purely for inspiration.

# Step 1: Write your own Biography

**List five of your strengths** that are relevant for the work setting you want to be in.

**Have a look at your desk research:** which capabilities did you highlight as most valuable for the vacancy? Identify the top five.

**Make a selection of three to five strengths** you want to share in your biography. Select these strengths the following way:

- **Compare the two lists** of five traits from your personal strengths and from the vacancy text. If there is any overlap in your lists, make sure to mention those traits in your bio to show you are a good fit.
- **Think about your added value.** What strength did you list in the first step, that isn't mentioned in the vacancy? Mention this personal strength in your biography to show your added value.

**Demonstrate your ability** with the help of personal examples. Get inspired by our examples below.

**Share your career goals** and elaborate on your motivation. Especially when you are making a career switch, it is important to explain why you are making this move.

**Check what you have written.** Does it feel complete? Did you manage to keep it brief? We advise you to have a biography of **5 to max. 8 sentences.**

_Example Biographies:_

<!-- 
I’m an experienced and data-driven recruitment consultant with a proven track record of filling complex vacancies. I win the trust of clients and candidates by striving for excellence through data-driven decision-making. I believe continuous learning results in a happier life and more career fulfillment, which is why I follow at least one course a year. Most recently I graduated from Data Analytics with Power Bi, at Winc Academy. Among other things, this course taught me how to identify top candidates and analyze what the best hires have in common. 

Growing up in a family with four other siblings, I've learned to be an authentic relationship builder who truly connects and listens to others. My friends know me for meaningful conversations and whipping up healthy meals, and occasionally poke me for interior design advice. I believe that all teams need connectors and relationship-builders to thrive.

Big Data is my crystal ball. I look for patterns and trends, identifying commercial opportunities. This is also where my strength lies: combining my analytical skills with a good understanding of the business purpose behind the analyses. Once I have conducted my research I am not afraid to present my insights, preferably with the help of visualization tools like PowerBI. A big achievement has been presenting a company update to over 200 people. I really enjoy learning and staying up-to-date on Big Data and the digital transformation in general. Just recently I graduated from Data Analytics with Power BI at Winc Academy.

# Step 2: Write your own Headline

**Select the keywords from your biography** you've just written, since the headline should cover the core message of your biography.

**Think of your most valued expertise and experience** for this specific vacancy. If your current job title is relevant to your application, you can use this as your header.

**Get inspired by examples** from our experts. Have a look below. If you feel it suits you, add some capabilities or passions to your headline.

**Write a comprehensive and unique headline:**

- which **fits** the vacancy. It should include why you would be a good candidate for the role.
- which is **unique**. Make it speak for you. Check with yourself: would this headline apply to all candidates applying to this job, or does it show your uniqueness?
- which is **comprehensive**, min. 2 words, max. 2 sentences

_Example Headlines:_

<!-- 
"Experienced recruiter with a passion for Personal Branding"

"Graduates as Front_End Developer | Passionate about code and people | Making the connection between HR and ICT"

"I will use a data-driven approach to grow your business"

"Junior Data Analyst - in the making | Hunting patterns in complex data"

"I help people thake their career to new heights | Job Coach & HR manager"

"Salesforce Fanatic | Supporting People through Change | CRM expert"

"Web Developer with a passion for sustainability and systems"

# Work History & Education

_ The core of every resume: insights into your **work history** and **educational background**._

## Tips:

- Write in chronological order
- Prioritize your experience
- Describe what you have done
- Speak the language of the reader
- Don't use jargon
- Show what is most essential (due limited space)

**List your work history** - use the same structure for each role:

- Period, Name of the organization, and an understandable job title/description.
- 2 - 3 sentences to share your main responsibilities and introduce the role;
- 4 - 5 bullet points of main tasks you performed, milestones you achieved (express in numbers where possible), skills you developed.

**List your education** - select those studies that are (still) relevant and describe:

- Period, Name of the institution, title of studies.
- Share the main topics the studies was about or that you chose to specialize in.
- Bonus points: share any valued results and key takeaways.

# Technical Skills


But first we have to distinguish between **technical skills** & **soft skills**. 

**Technical skills can be learned** through schooling and can be measured. This includes your knowledge of software programmes, programming languages, CRM systems, or management theories. On the other hand, **soft skills refer to personality traits** such as time management, flexibility and presentation skills.

## Soft skills

**Soft skills belong in your biography.** There you share your most valued skills and demonstrate them with the help of examples. This is the only place to convince the reader of your soft skills. If you have completed the previous parts of this chapter, you have already nailed this.

## Technical skills

Of course, mentioning technical skills is of great importance if you have mastered any programming language. But if that is not for you, there might still be some relevant tech skills to mention. Think of CRM systems you have worked with, forecasting programs, management tools such as PRINCE2, or visual design tools. If you have a lot of technical skills, you can list all of them as long as they seem relevant to the vacancy.

## Rating 

Oh and lastly, please do not put a rating to your skills, unless you have a certification which provides you with an acknowledged rating to your skills. In all other cases the level of your ability in a certain skill is open to interpretation. Why would you give yourself 5 out of 5 stars for Salesforce and only 4 for PowerBI? The answer to this is subjective. By not putting a rating for skills you will also prevent difficult questions on your job interview, such as: "Why are you not as good in Power BI as in Salesforce? Could you be better?''

**Create a dedicated section** on your resume to list your technical skills. Often this is somewhere on the side, but see what fits your design.

**List all the technical skills you have mastered -** think of relevant software programs, management tools and programming languages you master. Don't forget the most recent skills you worked on in your Winc Academy course.

# Extra activities

Step 1: Share Courses & Certificates:
- **List all your relevant courses**, include the title, institute and period of studying. Whenever the title is not clear enough, elaborate a little on the content of the course.

- **List all your relevant gained certificates**, include full title and optionally an expiration date.

- **Don't forget** to mention your most recent course: Your Winc Academy course!
